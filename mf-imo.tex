\section{International Mathematics Olympiad and Other Competitions}

From the IMO home page:

The International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) is an annual mathematics
competition for highschool students. It is one of the International
Science Olympiads. The first IMO was held in Romania in 1959. The usual
size of an official delegation to an IMO is (a maximum of) six student
competitors and (a maximum of) two leaders. There is no official
``team''. The student competitors write two papers, on consecutive days,
each paper consisting of three questions. Each question is worth seven
marks.
