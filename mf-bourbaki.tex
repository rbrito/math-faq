\section{Who is N. Bourbaki?}

A group of mostly French mathematicians
which began meeting in the 1930s, aiming to write a thorough unified
account of all mathematics. They had tremendous influence on
the way math is done since. For a very accessible sampler see
Dieudonne Mathematics: The Music Of Reason (Orig. Pour L'honneur
De L'esprit Humain).


The founding is described in
Andre Weil's autobiography, titled something like ``memoir of
an apprenticeship'' (orig. Souvenirs D'apprentissage). There is a
usable book Bourbaki by J. Fang. Liliane Beaulieu has a book
forthcoming, which you can sample in ``A Parisian Cafe and
Ten Proto-Bourbaki Meetings 1934-1935'' in the Mathematical
Intelligencer 15 no.1 (1993) 27-35.

The history behind Bourbaki is also described in Scientific American,
May 1957.
