\section{Some Famous Mathematical Constants}
The new math constant site is located at


The Plouffe's Inverter site 
( http://www.lacim.uqam.ca/pi/table.html )

contains high precision values of
$\pi$, $e$, $\phi$, etc.  to many million digits,
including at least 10 million digits of $pi$,
$1/pi$, $\phi$ , 50 million digits of $e$, $\log 2$ to 58 million
digits, etc. It also contains the latest info on the computation
of math constants at the record page located at
http://www.lacim.uqam.ca/pi/records.html

Finally (in addition) the site contains nearly 85 million math
constants.
