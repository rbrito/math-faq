\section{Some Famous Mathematical Constants}

The new math constant site is located at

The Plouffe's Inverter site
(\url{http://www.lacim.uqam.ca/pi/table.html})

contains high precision values of $\pi$, $e$, $\phi$, etc.  to many
million digits, including at least 10 million digits of $pi$, $1/pi$,
$\phi$ , 50 million digits of $e$, $\log 2$ to 58 million digits,
etc. It also contains the latest info on the computation of math
constants at the record page located at
\url{http://www.lacim.uqam.ca/pi/records.html}

Finally (in addition) the site contains nearly 85 million math
constants.
