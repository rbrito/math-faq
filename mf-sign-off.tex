The \scimath FAQ, which was initially edited and compiled by Alex
Lopez-Ortiz is now a distributed effort of scientists in over five
countries.

At this time, the FAQ contains sections maintained by
\href{mailto:\emailalopez}{Alex Lopez-Ortiz},
\href{mailto:\emailnancy}{Nancy McGough}, and
\href{mailto:\emailhans}{Hans de Vreught}.  Several other sections are
in the works, on the hands of other volunteers. Since 2009, it is being
updated by Rogério Theodoro de Brito.

Any collaborations, suggestions or corrections are welcome. If you wish
to collaborate, send an e-mail to
\href{mailto:\emailrbrito}{Rogério Brito} or to
