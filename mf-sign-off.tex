The sci.math FAQ, which was initally edited and compiled by Alex
Lopez-Ortiz is now a distributed effort of scientists in over five
countries. At this time, the FAQ contains sections maintained by Alex
Lopez-Ortiz (\url{alopez-o@barrow.uwaterloo.ca}), Nancy McGough
(\url{nancym@ii.com}), and Hans de Vreught
(\url{J.P.M.deVreught@cs.tudelft.nl}). Several others sections are in
the works, on the hands of other volunteers.
