The \scimath FAQ, which was initially edited and compiled by Alex
Lopez-Ortiz is now a distributed effort of scientists in over five
countries.

At this time, the FAQ contains sections maintained by Alex Lopez-Ortiz
(\emailalopez), Nancy McGough (\emailnancy), and Hans de Vreught
(\emailhans).  Several other sections are in the works, on the hands of
other volunteers. Since 2009, it is being updated by Rogério Theodoro de
Brito.

Any collaborations, suggestions or corrections are welcome. If you wish
to collaborate, send an e-mail to \emailrbrito or to \emailalopez.
