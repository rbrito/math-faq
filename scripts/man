NAME
     mathTeX2text - converts (La)TeX mathematics to a ASCII human
                    readable format


SYNOPSIS
     mathTeX2text

DESCRIPTION
     MathTeX2text reads from standard input a set of LaTeX text, it
     produces as in the standard output a list of equations in human
     readable format with one math equation per line.

EXAMPLES

       % ./mathTeX2text

       Input:

       A related conjecture from Euler
       \[ x^n + y^n + z^n = c^n \mbox{ has no solution if n is} \geq 4 \]
       Noam Elkies gave a counterexample, namely $2682440^4 + 15365639^4 +
       18796760^4 = 20615673^4$.
       Next, a discussion on  $\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} f(x)^{f(x)}$.

       Output:

       x^n + y^n + z^n = c^n has no solution if n is >= 4
       2682440^4 + 15365639^4 + 18796760^4 = 20615673^4
       lim_(x --> oo) f(x)^(f(x))

BUGS

     It has no diagnostics. If anything goes wrong it just aborts.
     MathTeX2text also assumes math mode delimiters in the input file
     are balanced. At this time it does not handle newtheorem
     environments. This capability will be added to a future release.
     It was written with latex2html in mind. Standalone performance
     may be wobbly.
