### Other global variables ###############################################

# Separator between the body of text in a page and the child links
$CHILDLINE = "<HR>\n";		# For display with Mosaic 

# This is the line width measured in pixels and it is used to right justify
# equations and equation arrays; 
$LINE_WIDTH = 450;		

# Used in conjunction with AUTO_NAVIGATION

# The value of this variable determines how many words to use in each 
# title that is added to the navigation panel (see below)
# 
$WORDS_IN_NAVIGATION_PANEL_TITLES = 4;

### Navigation Panel ##########################################################
#
# The navigation panel is constructed out of buttons and section titles.
# These can be configured in any combination with arbitrary text and 
# HTML tags interspersed between them. 
# The buttons available are:
#
# $PREVIOUS - points to the previous section
# $UP  - points up to the "parent" section
# $NEXT - points to the next section
# $NEXT_GROUP - points to the next "group" section
# $PREVIOUS_GROUP - points to the previous "group" section
# $CONTENTS - points to the contents page if there is one
# $INDEX - points to the index page if there is one
#
# If the corresponding section exists the button will contain an
# active link to that section. If the corresponding section does
# not exist the button will be inactive.
#
# Also for each of the $PREVIOUS $UP $NEXT $NEXT_GROUP and $PREVIOUS_GROUP
# buttons there are equivalent $PREVIOUS_TITLE, $UP_TITLE, etc variables
# which contain the titles of their corresponding sections. 
# Each title is empty if there is no corresponding section.
#
# The subroutine below constructs the navigation panel in each page.
# Feel free to mix and match buttons, titles, your own text, your logos,
# and arbitrary HTML (the "." is the Perl concatenation operator).

sub navigation_panel {

    #  Start with a horizontal rule (3-d dividing line)
    "<HR> ".			
    
    # Now add few buttons with a space between them
